# Electronic-Prototyping-Briefcase
Electronic Prototyping Briefcase based on Raspberry PI access for testing.

# Parts
I will use many Evaluation boards from STM

* [STM32 Online Training](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/support/learning/stm32-education/stm32-online-training/stm32wl-online-training.html)
* [STM LoRa WAN Techonlogy](https://www.st.com/en/wireless-transceivers-mcus-and-modules/lorawan-technology.html)
* [P-NUCLEO-LRWAN2](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/evaluation-tools/product-evaluation-tools/stm32-nucleo-expansion-boards/p-nucleo-lrwan2.html)

## Breakdown
The P-NUCLEO-LRWAN2 STM32 Nucleo starter pack for LoRa® technology and high-performance (G)FSK/OOK/(G)MSK modulations is a development tool to learn and quickly develop low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) solutions. The pack contains both an LPWAN end-node and its related gateway. It is compatible with various LoRaWAN® network server providers. P-NUCLEO-LRWAN2 is intended for countries granting radio-communications access in frequency bands higher than 800 MHz.

The Gateway has a NUCLEO-F746ZG evaluation board under it

[STM32 Nucleo-144 development board](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/evaluation-tools/product-evaluation-tools/mcu-mpu-eval-tools/stm32-mcu-mpu-eval-tools/stm32-nucleo-boards/nucleo-f746zg.html#overview)

The Sensor boards use the STM32 Nucleo-64 development board with STM32L073RZ MCU

USI® in partnership with STMicroelectronics developed the LoRa® expansion board for STM32 Nucleo (I-NUCLEO-LRWAN1). This board is an integrated solution allowing anyone to learn and develop solutions using LoRa® and/or FSK/OOK technologies.

Sensors onboard

* ST accelerometer and magnetometer sensor (LSM303AGR)
* ST relative humidity and temperature sensor (HTS221)
* ST pressure sensor (LPS22HB) 

## CAD
First, we need to install KiCad, and do not worry if you do not know how to use it, I will post links to a very good series from Digi-Key if your OS does not have KiCad as an option, see the links for Digi-Key after below
* [KiCad](https://kicad.org/)
* [FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org/)

# Briefcase

I ordered this case for this project, the [Nanuk](https://nanuk.com/products/nanuk-920). It is Waterproof, drop-tested at 3 feet, and crushproof, if being run over by a truck. It comes in 8 colors, and are TSA-approved carry-on.

## Updates

A work in progress.
